Purpose:
- Define a standardized folder hierarchy for the TopsailAI system
- Provide centralized path constants for easy maintenance
- Ensure consistent file organization across different components
- Facilitate easy configuration changes if needed

Usage:
    from topsailai.workspace.folder_constants import FOLDER_ROOT, FOLDER_WORKSPACE

    # Use constants to build file paths
    file_path = FOLDER_WORKSPACE + "/my_file.txt"
"""

# Layer 1: Root directory for the entire TopsailAI system
# This is the top-level directory that contains all system components
FOLDER_ROOT = "/topsailai"

# Layer 2: Main system directories under the root
# These directories organize the system into functional areas

# Workspace directory - Contains active projects, user data, and working files
FOLDER_WORKSPACE = FOLDER_ROOT + "/workspace"

# Memory directory - Stores system memory, stories, and persistent data
FOLDER_MEMORY = FOLDER_ROOT + "/memory"

# Lock directory - Manages file locks and synchronization mechanisms
FOLDER_LOCK = FOLDER_ROOT + "/lock"

# Layer 3: Subdirectories within the main system directories
# These provide further organization within each functional area

# Story subdirectory - Contains story files and narrative data within the memory system
FOLDER_MEMORY_STORY = FOLDER_MEMORY + "/story"
