# project folder

- When the "project name" is clearly defined, you should place the generated code (including test code and operational scripts) inside `{workspace}/{project_name}`.
- The relevant folders need to be created in advance.

## project folder structure

It should include the following:

- folder: `cli`, store script files
- folder: `src`, store source code files
- folder: `tests`, store test files
- file: `README.md`, save detail info about of the project
