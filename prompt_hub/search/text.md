# Text Content Search

Please use efficient command-line text processing tools (such as grep, awk, sed, wc, head, tail, etc.) whenever possible to search and analyze text content.

1. Prioritize using combined commands - chain multiple tools through pipelines to improve efficiency.
2. Define clear search objectives - explicitly specify the exact content patterns to be found.
3. Consider performance optimization - use appropriate tools and parameters for large files.
