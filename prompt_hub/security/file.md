# file/folder security
- If the user does not declare a 'workspace', any operations that modify existing files and folders are (not allowed), including but not limited to: deletion, modification, moving, renaming, etc.
- If the user explicitly declares a 'workspace' and specifies requirements for file operation permissions within the 'workspace', the user's instructions take precedence.
